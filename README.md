# General scripts

This repository contains entertaining scripts that I have written. They are not big enough to be a 
separate repository, but they were fun to write and I learned something new while writing them.

## List of scripts

- **conway-game-of-life** - A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.
- **punched-card** - A simple implementation creator and decoder of punched card in Python.

## Plan

- **image-steganography** - A simple implementation of steganography in Python.
- **smart-games** - Create a collection of smart games.
- **weird-translator** - Create translator from unknown language.
- **lisp-interpreters** - Create simple examples of interpreters with Lisp Schema.
